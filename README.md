# Blaz
*Blaz* is a normalization solver for the language of S-terms, i.e. combinators
built using a single primitive combinator **S** and term application. Blaz
implements the approach of [1] reducing the initial problem to membership
testing for context-free grammars. The internal membership solver is using the
well-known CYK algorithm. The solver can be accelerated by performing a 
given constant number of reductions before the CYK algorithm is used.

## Features
Blaz provides a CLI interface. Available features include:
* Normalization decidability of given new-line separated S-terms,
  provided either on stdin or in given files.
* Listing of all non-normalizing S-terms of given size.
* Normalization speed-up using the standard reduction strategy for a given
  number of steps, before the slow, but deterministic normalization algorithm is
  used.

## Usage
> ./blaz -?

## Building & installation
Blaz is packaged using cabal. In order to build from source use:
```
cabal configure
cabal build
cabal install
```
